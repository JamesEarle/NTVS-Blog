        My interests focus predominantly on web and mobile development, as well
        as artificial intelligence and machine learning. I like to toy with IoT 
        applications as well, but regularly find myself coming back to Node.js.
        Outside of technology my passions are widespread, also being an avid musician and 
        coffee enthusiast.
